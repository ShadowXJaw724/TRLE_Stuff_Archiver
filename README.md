## TRLE Archive 

### The purpose of this archive is to store and ensure the safety of various assets for the Tomb Raider Level Editor community. This includes, but does not exclusively apply to- 
<ol>
  <li>Animation Files, as well as setup for them if such a situation calls for it.</li>
  <li>Texture Packs, both including original ones and also from various other games.</li>
  <li>Audio that was created solely for TRLE's usage- This will not include game audio but will include SFX.</li>
  <li>Objects in the .WAD and .WAD2 format depending on the context behind the case.</li>
  <li>Other things that could be used or are related to TRLE, or were uniquely made for TRLE and its events.</li>
</ol>

**This isn't an exhaustive archive so you cannot find everything on here. There are assets that are not allowed to be posted on other sites and we will respect that.**
